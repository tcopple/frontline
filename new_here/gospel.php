    <blockquote>"Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, 
      which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, 
      if you hold fast to the word I preached to you -- unless you believed in vain. 
      For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: 
      that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, 
      that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures . . ." -1 Corinthians 15:1-4

    The word <span class="red">"Gospel"</span> simply means good news.  What is the good news that Jesus came to bring?  What is the good news that is mentioned here in this passage from the Bible?  
    <br>
    <br>
    Fundamentally, the good news is that Jesus Christ died for our sins and that he rose again from death three days later.  But what makes that such good news?
    <br>
    <br>
    The story begins with God.  God is real.  He is in the room where you are sitting and reading this.  He knows your name -- in fact He knows the number of hairs on your head.  Scripture teaches that God created this world. Everything we see.  He designed it, and He made it good.  
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm sure it's obvious to you that this world is no longer the good place that God originally created.  Corruption entered in to the earth long before you and I were born and God calls that corruption sin.  It brings pain, hurt, sickness, disease, fear, and ultimately death.  It hangs all over every aspect of this world.  
    <br>
    <br>
    God is both good and just and this sin requires judgment.  It was love that led Him to send His Son to die as a substitute and take away the sin of the world.  Jesus Christ died for our sins and His death paid our debt.  This gives me the opportunity to seek God and find God.  My sin is placed on the shoulders of Jesus and His perfect holiness is placed on me.  
    <br>
    <br>
    The gospel allows me to move from rejected to accepted.  From empty to full.  From broken and sick to healed.  From orphaned to adopted.  From distant to close.
    <br>
    <br>
    Repentance is the process of changing my life purpose and following Jesus rather than following self.  Belief is the process of trusting this good news as true and allowing it to rearrange me on the inside.  It is not enough to know about God.  Each of us must personally repent and believe in this good news (Mark 1:15).  
    <br>
    <br>
    When we do that, we are changed.  Our affections, our desires, and our actions.  To follow Jesus is more than a mental decision.  It's an inward transformation.  
    <br>
    <br>
    This is the best news in the whole world.  Jesus Christ rose again.  Death, the exclamation point of sin could not hold Him.  He overcame the curse, and He did it for you.
