      Whether you're full of questions, battling loneliness, looking for somewhere to serve, or just seeking something authentic, City Church exists to walk with you.
    <br>
    <br>
      We began weekly gatherings on September 18, 2011 and are already experiencing the power of God in amazing ways.
    <br>
    <br>
      We'd also love to connect with you at one of our weekly <a href="/when_and_where/community.php">community</a> groups hosted in homes at various locations in New Haven.
