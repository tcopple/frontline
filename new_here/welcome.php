      Welcome to City Church! Our church community began meeting weekly in the fall of 2011 and we have been amazed by all that God has done since the church launched.  City Church exists to spread the lifestyle of authentic Christianity for God’s glory and the transformation of our city.  We welcome you to visit our weekly services or one of our <a href="/when_and_where/community.php">Community Groups</a>.

          In 2001, a small team of Christians led by Pastor Rick Rocco founded Frontline Christian Church. Justin Kendrick was eighteen years old and one of the members of that original team.  He felt a call from God to continue to pursue Christian ministry, and in 2004 Justin and his wife Chrisy launched Holyfire Ministries and began traveling throughout the country and abroad.

          Through training conferences, campus outreaches, and overseas ministry, HFM has seen hundreds of people turn to Christ and embrace a lifestyle of authentic Christian living. They started, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/outofhidingmusic">“Out of Hiding”</a> in 2008 as the band of missional musicians, sharing the gospel and inspiring Christians to wholeheartedly practice their faith.

          In 2010, Justin felt God’s direction to launch a church in his home city.  After receiving the support of Pastor Rick Rocco and his church family at Frontline, Justin and the team at HFM launched City Church with weekly services on September 18, 2011. Whether as a pastor, evangelist, or musician, Justin’s single focus is to see the person of Jesus magnified and his fame spread across New England and beyond.
