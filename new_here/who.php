      Frontline City Church is a group of people who have been forgiven and changed by Jesus and live as missionaries in the greater New Haven area.  
      We gather weekly in community groups at various locations throughout the region and monthly at different venues beginning on EASTER SUNDAY at Toad's Place on York Street in New Haven.
      Our first weekly Sunday morning service is slotted for September 18, 2011.
