    <h3 class="yellow bold">Our Story</h3>
      Like any crazy story, the journey of this Christian community has been full of incredible moments. Our first public gathering was held on Easter Sunday, 2011 at Toad's Place in downtown New Haven, Connecticut. We never expected the type of response that we experienced. As a small group of us prayed, asking God to touch the city with His love, people from all walks of life began to filter in. Yale students joined with single moms, and elderly grandparents stood beside high school students as everyone gathered to worship Jesus on Easter. The local temple to the god's of rock and roll was transformed into a sanctuary of worship to the God of the universe. And in that moment, a dream began to take shape.
    <br><br>
    <a href="http://vimeo.com/23513849">News Channel 8</a> ran a story about our meeting that night on the news and the <a href="http://www.newhavenregister.com/articles/2011/04/24/news/doc4db4a4d812fbc811044006.txt">New Haven Register</a> reported the service the next morning in the paper. From there, the story took flight as CNN, USA Today and many others shared about our Easter Service at Toad's.
    <br><br>
    Since then, Frontline City Church has been meeting monthly at different locations throughout downtown New Haven. The summer has been marked by the "I &lt;3 New Haven" campaign as we've partnered with local non-profits to mobilize people to serve the city.
    <br><br>
    We officially launch our weekly services on September 18, 2011 at Co-op High School.
    <br><br>
    For us, the dream has only begun to take shape. We believe that God is real, that the scriptures are true, and that His love for the world is beyond words. The dream of our community is to spread a lifestyle of authentic Christianity, and see our city experience this irresistible love.

    <h3 class='yellow bold'>Roots</h3>
    In 2001, a small team of Christians led by Pastor Rick Rocco founded Frontline Christian Church. Justin Kendrick was one of the members of that original team and felt a call from God to continue to pursue Christian ministry. In 2004, Justin and his wife Chrisy launched Holyfire Ministries full time and began to travel throughout the country and abroad. Their purpose was simple: <span class='bold'>to capture the heart of this generation and ignite authentic Christianity.</span>
    <br><br>
    For six years Justin and Chrisy, along with their team of missionaries, have been traveling to various places using every means possible to share Jesus in relevant ways and reach people for Christ. Their band, Out of Hiding, has become an effective mouthpiece for the ministry, and the team currently produces books, devotionals, conferences, internships, campus outreaches and service initiatives. Working with hundreds of churches over the last six years, this team has fallen in love with the local church and the need to reach cities for Christ.
    <br><br>
    As Holyfire Ministries continues to grow and focuses on seeing spiritual awakening in New England, Justin felt a tug from God to launch a church to reach his home city. After meeting with Pastor Rick and receiving his wholehearted support, Justin and Chrisy began the process to launch Frontline City Church in New Haven, Connecticut. Justin is leading the launch team for City Church and continues to lead and travel extensively with Holyfire Ministries. Whether as a pastor, an evangelist, or a musician, Justin's single focus is to glorify God and spread His fame throughout a broken world.
