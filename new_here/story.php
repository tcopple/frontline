    <h3 class="yellow bold">Our Story</h3>
      Like any crazy story, the journey of this Christian community has been full of incredible moments. Our first public gathering was held on Easter Sunday, 2011 at Toad's Place in downtown New Haven, CT. We never expected the type of response that we experienced. As a small group of us prayed, asking God to touch the city with His love, people from all walks of life began to filter in. Yale students joined with single moms, and elderly grandparents stood beside high school students as everyone gathered to worship Jesus on Easter. The local temple to the god's of rock and roll was transformed into a sanctuary of worship to the God of the universe. And in that moment, a dream began to take shape.

    <a href="http://vimeo.com/23513849">News Channel 8</a> ran a story about our meeting that night on the news and the <a href="http://www.newhavenregister.com/articles/2011/04/24/news/doc4db4a4d812fbc811044006.txt">New Haven Register</a> reported the service the next morning in the paper. From there, the story took flight as CNN, USA Today and many others shared about our Easter Service at Toad's.
    <br><br>
    Since then, Frontline City Church has been meeting monthly at different locations throughout downtown New Haven. The summer has been marked by the "I &lt;3 New Haven" campaign as we've partnered with local non-profits to mobilize people to serve the city.
    <br><br>
    We officially launched our weekly services on September 18, 2011 at Co-op High School.
    <br><br>
    For us, the dream has only begun to take shape. <span class='bold'>We believe that God is real, that the scriptures are true, and that His love for the world is beyond words. The dream of our community is to spread a lifestyle of authentic Christianity, and see our city experience this irresistible love.</span>
