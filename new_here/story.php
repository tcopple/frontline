    <h3 class="yellow bold">Our Story</h3>
    In 2001 Pastor Rick Rocco had a dream to launch a church called Frontline to reach a generation.  Over the coming months and years that dream became a reality as a handful of young leaders started a church and saw it grow.  Justin Kendrick was one of the members of that original team and felt a call from God to continue to pursue Christian ministry.  In 2004, Justin and his wife Chrisy launched Holyfire Ministries full time and began to travel throughout the country and abroad.  Their purpose was simple: to capture the heart of this generation and ignite authentic Christianity.  
    <br><br>
    For six years Justin and Chrisy, along with their team of missionaries have been traveling to various places using every means possible to share Jesus in relevant ways and reach people for Christ. Their band, Out of Hiding has become an effective mouthpiece for the ministry, and the team currently produces books, devotionals, conferences, internships, campus outreaches, and service initiatives. Partnering with hundreds of churches over the last six years, this team has fallen in love with the local church and the need to reach cities for Christ.

    As Holyfire Ministries continues to grow and focuses on seeing spiritual awakening in New England, Justin felt a tug from God to launch a church to reach his home city of New Haven.  After meeting with Pastor Rick Rocco and receiving his wholehearted support, Justin and Chrisy began the process to launch Frontline City Church in New Haven, Connecticut.  Justin is leading the launch team for the church and continues to lead and travel extensively with Holyfire Ministries.  Whether as a pastor, an evangelist, or a musician, Justin's single focus is to glorify God and spread His fame throughout a broken world.
