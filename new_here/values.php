    <h3 class="yellow bold">Our Values</h3>
    Our community holds certain values as central to who we are and what God has called us to do.  Here are some key values that we seek to embody.
    <br>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">It's all about Jesus</h5>
    <p>
    Jesus is the king of all the earth and to follow Him means to subject every area of our lives to His direction.  Christ sits at the center of all the intentions and actions of the believer, and we live as missionaries to reach others for Jesus.  Corporately, our central focus is to spread His fame and advance His Kingdom.  We joyfully work with other churches and ministries for the purpose of spiritual transformation in our cities, region, and nation.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">Small is the New Big</h5>
    <p>
    We greatly value larger corporate gatherings to clarify vision, teaching, and to worship.  We also deeply value regular small group meetings to walk through the process of becoming more like Jesus, care for the needs of others, and practice spiritual gifts.  
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">We Change by Grace</h5>
    <p>
    It is the grace of God that saves us, delivers us, and makes us holy.  We are committed to living a life of grace-filled-effort striving not in our own strength but in the grace of God.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">God Gets the Glory</h5>
    <p>
    Our motivation and intentions in all things is the glory of God.  We aim to glorify Him in every area of life, and to corporately worship Him to bring Him glory.  
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">Leaders Serve</h5>
    <p>
    We believe that status in God's kingdom is measured not by what you have but by how you serve others.  Power and responsibility must be leveraged for the growth and benefit of others and the glory of God.  
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">Cities Belong to Jesus</h5>
    <p>
    We believe that God awakens cities.  We aim to play a part in His plan to bring spiritual awakening to our city, our region, and our nation in the hopes of reaching the world with the gospel.
