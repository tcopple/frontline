    <h3 class="yellow bold">Our Values</h3>
    City Church holds certain values as central to who we are and what God has called us to do.
    <br>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">It's all about Jesus</h5>
    <p>
    The redemption found in the death and resurrection of Jesus is the great cure for the disease of sin and all its effects. Scripture is inspired by God, Jesus is King over all things, and life’s purpose is to glorify him, know him, and share the good news of his kingdom. His influence and purpose permeates every compartment of our lives.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">Small is the New Big</h5>
    <p>
    Spiritual growth develops effectively in the context of small community. Though we value large gatherings for teaching, training and collective worship, small gatherings hold the keys to personal discipleship.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">We Change by Grace</h5>
    <p>
    It is the grace of God that saves us, delivers us, and makes us holy. We are committed to living a life of grace-filled-effort striving not in our own strength but in the grace of God. God’s people are holy people, and his grace empowers us to live holy. By grace every Christian can be filled with the Holy Spirit and display the fruit of the Spirit and practice the gifts of the Spirit.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">God Gets the Glory</h5>
    <p>
    Our motivation and intentions in all things is the glory of God, not ourselves. We seek to glorify him in everything and collectively worship him.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">Leaders Serve</h5>
    <p>
    Jesus said that servants were the greatest in his kingdom. Power and responsibility must be leveraged for the growth and benefit of others and the glory of God. Jesus is the chief shepherd and senior pastor over all the sheep and all leaders live in submission to him.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h5 class="red">Cities Belong to Jesus</h5>
    <p>
    We believe that God awakens cities. Our goal is spiritual awakening in our cities, our region, and our nation in the hopes of reaching the world with the gospel.
