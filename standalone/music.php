      City Church worship is overseen by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/outofhidingmusic">Out of Hiding</a>, a community of musicians who seek to lead people closer to Jesus and spread a lifestyle of authentic Christianity through inspired music.  Writing, living, and worshipping together, this team of musicians travels throughout the northeast and abroad, and has been a foundational part of the launch and growth of City Church.  Whether it’s at our weekend gatherings at City Church, or on the road, Out of Hiding exists to glorify Jesus and spread His fame.<br>
